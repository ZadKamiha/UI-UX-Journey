# ðŸŽ¯ What is The Difference between UI and UX?
<b> Is there a difference between UI and UX? ðŸ¤” </b>
- YES! **User Interface (UI)** focuses on creating attractive interfaces that users can easily interact with. UI designers are responsible for designing the layout, color scheme, typography, icons, buttons, and other elements that make up the interface.</br>
- **User Experience (UX)** covers everything regarding the user experience, from basic functionality to interactions. UX designers are responsible for understanding the needs, goals, and pain points of the users, and creating solutions that address them. UX designers are involved in conducting user research, creating user personas, mapping user journeys, building wireframes and prototypes, testing and validating design decisions, and collaborating with stakeholders, UI designers, and developers. UX design is mainly concerned with the usability and desirability of the product or service. <br>
